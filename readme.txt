This repository contain various files that were developped during long time by somebody who was learning how to programming, not by a professional, having no warranty of correct results.

Three of these could be compiled producing three programs that work together as a daily planner. 
The functions provided by them are:
-See task for a day (ph.cpp)
-Add task for a day (np.cpp)
-Remove some today task from the agenda (rph.cpp)

The rest of files should be header-files (they are not), containing auxiliar functions and classes, but they contain some
useful ones and a lot of generic algorithms made for another purposes.

If you like this 'parahoy' planner, you can tell me and maybe I could organize it, getting a optimized and more readable code.
